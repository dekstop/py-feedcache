 ==============================
 = personalised planet music  =
 ==============================

- aggregate loads of music blogs
- filter by last.fm username:
  - extract top artists
  - search for those across feed archive
  - return result as river of news

requirements:
- huge list of music blogs 
- feed cache set up + stable on paris
  - either: dedicated crawler, specific to this app (too wasteful)
  - or: shared crawler, but bundling all feeds we care about for this app
    - by linking to a feedcache user account (or user tag)
  - make sure it can ingest all music feeds ^^
- last.fm integration
  - web service call
  - cache response (for how long? 1h? 1 day?)
  - extract top artists
- fast feed archive search
  - for a quick demo postgres keyword search may be enough?
    - http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/textsearch.html
    - additional column: contains all searchable text columns, stripped off any markup, is used to build index
      - trigger to keep up to date
    - postgres even has result highlighing! -> ts_headline(...)
  - otherwise: look for good search engine
- web ui
  - basically a form and a river of news
  - crucial: sanitise html heavily!
  - doesn't even need pagination for a demo
  - if search is fast enough: also publish as feed
  - if time left: provide item context
    - which artist does this match? with your playcount, artist image, links
    - highlight matching keywords
  - if more time left: export matching blogs/feeds as OPML
  - if still time left: exploration features
    - "only results for this artist"
    - "see also" (based on simartist, ...?)
    - keyword search
  - publish sources (as static page, as opml so people can subscribe) -- title, link

 ===========
 = sources =
 ===========

- hypem; other listings? 
- check own feeds (pop culture, etc)
- planets?
- google reader music bundle: DJMag, NME, AllHipHop, Rapnews, Pitchfork media

 =======================
 = feed implementation =
 =======================

- publish matching artists as entry topics (with link to last.fm?)
- 

 ============================
 = existing implementations =
 ============================

- http://www.programmableweb.com/mashup/last.fm-favourite-artist-news multi-artist google blog search (fed from last.fm profile), via yahoo pipes, only returns a feed
- http://www.mashupkeyword.com/news?keyword=hip%20hop (google, technorati for genre/artist search)
- http://www.musicportl.com/artist/Johnny+Long (technorati artist search)
- etc (except for matt perdeaux' thing most seem focused on single-artist search)
