 = personalised planet music  =
 ==============================

- A personalised music news ticker service that keeps you informed about stuff you care about. 
- aggregated from hundreds of music blogs
- Your taste changes, so your ticker service should adapt. 
  - Don't subscribe to specific blogs, or even specific topics (keyword searches, ...); 
  - instead use Last.fm to keep track of your current habits
  -> no work, always up to date.

- aggregate loads of music blogs
- filter by last.fm username:
  - extract top artists
  - search for those across feed archive
  - return result as river of news

requirements:
- huge list of music blogs 
  - almost done. missing: big magazines, gossip blogs
- last.fm integration
  - web service call to http://www.last.fm/api/show?service=300 (last 3 months)
  - cache response (for how long? 1h? 1 day?)
  - extract top artists
- fast feed archive search
  - for a quick demo postgres keyword search may be enough?
    - http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/textsearch.html
    - additional column: contains all searchable text columns, stripped off any markup, is used to build index
      - trigger to keep up to date
    - postgres even has result highlighing! -> ts_headline(...)
  - otherwise: look for good search engine
- web ui
  - basically a form and a river of news
  - crucial: sanitise html heavily!
    - http://www.feedparser.org/docs/html-sanitization.html
    - should probably also strip any css
  - doesn't even need pagination for a demo
  - if search is fast enough: also publish as feed
  - if time left: provide item context
    - which artist does this match? with your playcount, artist image, links
    - highlight matching keywords
  - if more time left: export matching blogs/feeds as OPML
  - if still time left: exploration features
    - "only results for this artist"
    - "see also" (based on simartist, ...?)
    - keyword search
  - publish sources (as static page, as opml so people can subscribe) -- title, link

- "the echo nest claims to mine a lot of blogs"
  - http://developer.echonest.com/docs/method/get_blogs/
  - crawl http://www.twingly.com/ searches ("mp3", last.fm top 1000 artists, ...)
  - others?
- gossip blogs!

 ============================

- http://www.programmableweb.com/mashup/last.fm-favourite-artist-news multi-artist google blog search (fed from last.fm profile), via yahoo pipes, only returns a feed
- http://www.mashupkeyword.com/news?keyword=hip%20hop (google, technorati for genre/artist search)
- http://www.musicportl.com/artist/Johnny+Long (technorati artist search)
- etc (except for matt perdeaux' thing most seem focused on single-artist search)
